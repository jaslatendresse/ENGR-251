            <p>Thermodynamics is the field of physics that explains the relationships between energy and a defined system. The system can be as small as a water drop or as big as the universe. This branch of science is more specifically concerned with heat, temperature, specific heat, entropy, pressure, enthalpy, etc...All of which are properties defining the said system. For many years, we have been interested in describing how a system interacts with its surroundings or how two bodies exchange energy whether it's by heat transfer or mechanical work. </p>
            
            <p>While many of our daily life activites such as brewing a simple cup of coffee can be described with thermonadynamics, we will mainly focus on what is considered to be, even up to this day, the absolute truth: <b>The First Law of Thermodynamics.</b> </p>

            <h1>First Law of Thermodynamics</h1>
            
            <p>Consider a hot cup of freshly french pressed coffee left on a table. Assuming that the coffee and its environment are at different temperatures, the first law requires that the heat moved from the cup of coffee is the same as the heat added to its surroundings.</p>
            
            <p> The first law of thermodynamics can be applies to two different types of system: a closed system and an open system. A closed system is also called a control mass because the mass of the system can never cross the boundaries; it remains constant at all times. An open system is said to be a control volume because while the mass can flow in an out, the volume remains constant at all times.<br> For further topics such as entropy, a third system called isolated system is being considered. In this case, no energy or mass can cross the boundaries. Therefore the system does not interact with its suroundings.</p>

            <h3>Closed System - Conservation of enegery</h3>
            <img style="border:1px solid black;"src="http://i.imgur.com/aBDPn8Q.png">
            <p> Consider the following closed system.</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/4PFYLfh.png">
            <p> The above equation states that the change in energy is the difference between the heat supplied to the system (Q) and the work done by the system (W). In general, E = U+ Ke + Pe + any kind of energy. For this particular case, we are mostly concerned with U, internal energy. Hence, the first law of thermodynamics for closed system is also called the law of conservation of energy meaning that any type of energy supplied to the system comes out of it.</p>
            <p> It is sometimes useful to consider the change in energy over time. In this case, the equation becomes:</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZUmN4kM.png">
            <p> in which Q/dt represents the heat flow rate and W/dt represents the work flow rate.</p>
            
            <p>When doing calculations using the first law, it is important to respect the sign convention for each variable. It is defined as follow:</p>
            <table border="1">
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <td><b>Positive</b></td>
                    <td><b>Negative</b></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Heat (Q)</b></td>
                    <td>Heat is supplied to the system</td>
                    <td>Heat is rejected (extracted) from the system</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Work (W)</b></td>
                    <td>Work is done by the system on its surroundings</td>
                    <td>Work is done on the system (supplied to) by its surroundings</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Internal Energy (dU)</b></td>
                    <td>The temperature has rised or change of phase of a substance contained in the system (melting or evaporating)</td>
                    <td>The temperature has dropped or change of phase of a substance in the system (freezing or condensing)</td>
                </tr>

            <p></p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/avdHxG1.png">
            <p>Considering an open system with one inlet and one outlet, the first law of thermodynamics can be written as follow:</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/9Z1Hh5q.png">
            <p>which states that the total change in energy is given by the difference between the heat and work flow rate added to the difference between the total energy at inlet and the total energy at outlet relative to the mass flow rate. The total energy is enthalpy (h), velocity (v) and potential energy (gz). In many cases, potential energy is neglected.</p>
            <p>In the case where there are several inlets and outlets, the equation simply becomes:</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/2evUaBf.png">
            <p>The mass flow rate depends on the velocity as well as the area of the inlet or outlet it is going through. Therefore, it can be calculated with this formula:</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/jPflnVT.png">
            <p>where V is the velocity, A is the area and œÅ is the substance density.</p>
            <p>Finally, in the case of a steady state, the change in energy over time is constant which implies that the mass flow rate at the inlet is equal to the mass flow rate at the outlet</p>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/6Xn7zI4.png">
            <p>and the conservation of mass equation becomes:</p>
