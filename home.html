            <p>Thermodynamics is the field of physics that explains the relationships between energy and a defined system. The system can be as small as a water drop or as big as the universe. This branch of science is more specifically concerned with heat, temperature, specific heat, entropy, pressure, enthalpy, etc...All of which are properties defining the said system. For many years, we have been interested in describing how a system interacts with its surroundings or how two bodies exchange energy whether it's by heat transfer or mechanical work. </p>
            
            <p>While many of our daily life activites such as brewing a simple cup of coffee can be described with thermonadynamics, we will mainly focus on what is, even up to this day, considered to be the absolute truth: <b>The First Law of Thermodynamics.</b> </p>
