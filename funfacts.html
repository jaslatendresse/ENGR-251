<div class="contentfacts1">
    <h3>Every time energy is used, some free energy (available to make things happen) gets lost as heat.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts2">
    <h3>Scientists use the word ‘entropy’ to describe how much energy has become unusable. <br>The less free energy there is, the greater the entropy.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts1">
    <h3>The word ‘entropy’ was invented by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius in 1865.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts2">
    <h3>Clausius showed that everything really happens because energy moves from areas of high energy to areas of low energy,<br> from hot areas to cold areas.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts1">
    <h3>Energy goes on flowing from high to low until there is no difference to make anything happen.<br> This is an equilibrium state. Entropy is the maximum.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts2">
    <h3>Energy cannot be reused once it has turned to heat and dissipated, just as you cannot rebuild an igloo once the snow has melted.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts1">
    <h3>Clausius summed this idea up in 1860s with two laws of thermodynamics.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts2">
    <h3>The first law of thermodynamics says the total energy in the Universe was fixed forever at the beginning of time.</h3>
</div>

<div class="contentfacts1">
    <h3>The second law of thermodynamics says that energy is dissipated every time it is used. So the entropy of the Universe must increase.</h3>
